# Sign In
This folder contains the files that create the sign in page as well as another folder for handling forgetting information

SignIn.html:
The SignIn.html file handles the basic creation of the sign in page, creating input boxes for a username and password as well as adding links to pages that handle forgotten information.

SignIn.js:
The SignIn.js file makes the sign in page more interactive. In this current version, the only additional interactivity added by the SignIn.js file is the ability to toggle the visibility of the password.

SignInStyles.css:
The SignInStyles.css file is used to make the sign in page more aesthetically pleasing compared to the plain html document generated by the SignIn.html file. This includes the repositioning and alignment of the input boxes and links, as well as changing font colors and defining font types.

ForgotInfo:
The ForgotInfo folder includes the files for the pages used for when a user has forgotten their password or their username. These are covered in more detail in the README file within the ForgotInfo folder.
