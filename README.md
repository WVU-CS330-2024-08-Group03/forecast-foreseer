PROJECT
Forecast Foreseer
This project is a development of a website for CS 330. This website aims to utilize NOAA data and showcase weather-pertaining information in a unique and thought-out system. We chose to create a simple weather website that provides general weather data and alerts, a map of the user's current location, a calendar feature, and suggestions for activity based on the current weather.

MOTIVATION
We wish to simplify the process of making outdoor plans/trips by having one site to view the weather and add events to your schedule. Knowing we would have limited time on this project, we decided to keep the website simple to ensure the best performance with the skills we had.

CODING DETAILS
We utilized the software of VScode and connected it with Github. The languages used are javascript, css, html, react app, etc.

HOW TO USE
To open the website, the main page file is run. A prompt asking for the user's location. Once the location is given, the weather stats are displayed. Users can choose to make an account in the upper right corner. A link to the calendar feature is available to click on, which will navigate the user to a separate page on the website. This page shows the full calendar grid in which the user can navigate to the previous or future months. The user is then able to add an event to any day by clicking the day's box and inputting the event's general information. When navigating back to the main page, any upcoming events are displayed in an iframe for easy visibility.
